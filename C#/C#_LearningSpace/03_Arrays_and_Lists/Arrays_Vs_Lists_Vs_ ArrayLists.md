Arrays:
    
    -Hold one data type
    -length set at setup
    -Immutable (can not add or delete just over right )

Lists:
    -Hold one data type
    -Contain many methods (Add, Remove, Sort ...)
    -Requires 'using System.Collection.Generic;'
    -Mutable (can add or delete items)
    -Overall length not set

    **** Lists are most Prefereable compared to all three choices.
